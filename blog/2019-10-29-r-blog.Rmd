# Required Package

To make our own R package, we will use devtools and roxygen2 packages. Make sure to install these two packages using install.packages() function.

# Create the Package

First of all, create a new project in a new directory in File >> New Project.

![](/blog/2019-10-29-r-blog_files/1.jpg)

Select the project type as an R Package.

![](/blog/2019-10-29-r-blog_files/2.bmp)

Name the R Package, select the working directory where the R package will be in, and click 'Create Package'.

![](/blog/2019-10-29-r-blog_files/3.jpg)

Here, we have the folder for our package. We can see it on the right bottom part of our RStudio.

# Implementation of Package

To write a useful package, you may create the function, documentation, and the sample data for the package.

## Create a Function

Go to File >> New File >> R Script to create an R file with a function for our package.

Here, I will do a sample bubble plot function with ggplot. A bubble plot can show 3 numeric variables in a 2-d plot. Usually, one variable will be shown by the size of the point, so we can use geom_point function to plot this. This kind of plot is straight forward especially with one variable related to the number or the size of the data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Bubble Plot Function

library(ggplot2)
bubble_plot <- function(df, varx, vary, varz){
  ggplot(df, aes(x=get(varx), y=get(vary), size = get(varz))) +
    geom_point(fill="blue", color="darkred") + 
    labs(x = varx, y = vary, size = varz)
}
```

Here, ggplot2 package will be used. We can save this R Script as bubble_plot.R in the R folder of our package.

We can take a loot at this function.

```{r}
# Draw sample plot with the function.

df.test <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10),
                      y = rnorm(10),
                      z = rnorm(10))
bubble_plot(df.test, 'x', 'y', 'z')

```

Here, open the folder R, there should be an R Script file named bubble_plot.R

## Write the document.

Make sure you are still under the working directory of the package by checking the directory under the console.

Library the required packages in the concole.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
```

Keep the script bubble_plot.R open, go to Code >> Insert Roxygen Skeleton. This will add documentation to the function. The script will be like this. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
#' Title
#'
#' @param df 
#' @param varx 
#' @param vary 
#' @param varz 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
bubble_plot <- function(df, varx, vary, varz){
  ggplot(df, aes(x=get(varx), y=get(vary), size = get(varz))) +
    geom_point(fill="blue", color="darkred") + 
    labs(x = varx, y = vary, size = varz)
}
```

We can take a look into the parameters we may use.

* @param indicates the parameters you used

* @return indicates the return type

* @export is to add this function to the NAMESPACE file, so that it will be accessible to users

* @importFrom indicates the packages needed

* @examples is where you can write an example, like what we did above

We can also open the DESCRIPTION file in the root index of the package to edit the Title, Version, Author of this package.

## Add Sample Data

To add sample data to the package, make a data folder. Just click on the New Folder bottom on the right bottom of the RStudio.

Save the data in using .RData file by type the following in the console.

`r ''`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Sample data
sample_data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10),
                          y = rnorm(10),
                          z = rnorm(10))
                          
save(sample_data, 
     file = 'ExamplePackage/data/sample_data.RData')
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Install and Check the Packages

Using document function in the consule to check the package, make sure you are in the same working directory as the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check the function
document()
```

Then go down one level in the working director and run the following code in the console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Go down one level
setwd('..')

# Install the package
install('ExamplePackage')
```

After the process finishes, the implement of our package successes.

## Check the Document and Data

Type in the console to test the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# See the document
?bubble_plot

# See the data
data(sample_data)
```

# Upload the Package

Make a new repository with the same name as our package, and make it public. Add the package to Github.

To install our package from the Github just type in console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('yourusername/ExamplePackage')
```
